📦 ByteNode - Distributed File Storage System using Django + IPFS
ByteNode is a distributed file storage solution built using Django and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). Designed for high availability, fault tolerance, and efficient file management, ByteNode intelligently chunks and distributes files across multiple nodes, ensuring redundancy and reliability.

🚀 Key Features
🔐 Secure Authentication: Django-based user login, registration, and role management

📁 File Chunking: Automatically splits files into 1MB chunks for scalable upload and download

🌐 IPFS Integration: Redundant storage across multiple IPFS nodes to ensure data persistence

🩺 Health Monitoring: Detects and repairs missing chunks, supports self-healing mechanisms

⚖️ Load Balancing: Prevents node overload with dynamic chunk redistribution

🧩 Chunk Tracking: View detailed metadata and distribution of every file

🛠️ Admin Dashboard: Visual system stats, node diagnostics, and distribution health checks

🌍 RESTful API: Complete API set for file management and node configuration
